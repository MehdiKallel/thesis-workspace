#Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode for drug traceability

Counterfeiting drugs is a big issue in the pharmaceutical industry. The increasing public use of online pharmacies has made the monitoring of the drug supply chain process complicated. This chapter proposes a blockchain-based system that tracks drugs in the supply chain process. The proposed Chaincode makes it possible to execute transactions between different organizations without a trusted centralized authority and provides records of every transaction performed on the network. The developed Chaincode also demonstrates the use of private data collection in Hyperledger Fabric.

## Overview



```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
